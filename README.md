This is for the Library Management System with Database Integration: Mini Project. The user is given the option to pick from five options. Once selected the user will be prompted to input the information needed to carry our the task.  This Library Management System will allow you to add, search, and view books, authors, users, and genres. There is also the option in the books operation to borrow and return a book. Once you borrow a book the system will change the books availability so that no other user may borrow the book. These borrowed books have their own table which shows which book was borrowed, by which user, and the borrowed and return date.
